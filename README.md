# machine_learning_with_sklearn


End-to-end, reproducible ML pipeline using **scikit-learn**:
- Synthetic dataset generation (binary classification)
- Train/validation/test split with stratification
- Preprocessing with `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline`
- Model comparison (Logistic Regression vs Random Forest)
- Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
- Metrics & plots (ROC AUC, PR AUC, Confusion Matrix)
- Model persistence with `joblib`
- Deterministic runs (fixed random seeds)
- Zero external data dependency

> This project is intentionally compact so itâ€™s easy to read, run, and fork.
